Installing
----------

These instruction assume you are using [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) as your LaTeX
distribution.

The makefile is set up to install to the users local `texmf`-directory by default. Before running
the makefile you should run:

```bash
tlmgr init-userdir              # to setup your local texmf dir
kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME  # this should output the path to your local texmf dir
```

To install your local `texmf`-directory, do:

```bash
make install
```

To install to a different `texmf`-directory, do:

```bash
make -e TEXMF=path/to/texmf install
```
